DBMS - A software system so we can perform CRUD - Create Read Update Delete operations

2 types:
Relational - SQL - Has rows and columns - ORACLE, MySQL, PostgreSQL, mariaDB
Non Relational - NoSQL - No rows/columns - Has graphs, JSON(javascript object notation), XML - MpngoDB, dynamoDB, Apache cassandra, firebase

Table and Keys:
Primary key - An attribute that represents the row - Basically, a column name that is unique
Foreign key - Stores primary key of 1 table in another table - Basically, a table has 2 primary keys but one is foreign -Acts as a Linkage
Composite key - Needs 2 attributes - 2 keys together are needed so as to uniquely identify - The keys separately have redundant info but together make sense
